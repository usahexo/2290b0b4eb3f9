#  Mysterious J Discovered Inside South Dakota Blackjack Tables!

For the last few weeks, a new and mysterious type of disc has been turning up inside blackjack tables at casinos in South Dakota. The discs, which have been given the moniker “J discs” by casino staff, are about the size of a nickel and appear to be made out of some sort of metal alloy. So far, no one has been able to identify what the discs are or where they came from.

Blackjack dealers at several different casinos have reported finding J discs inside their tables, and while there have been some theories as to what they might be, no one has been able to confirm anything. Some people have speculated that the discs might be some sort of promotional item or reward from the casino, but officials at all of the casinos where J discs have been found say that they have no knowledge of where the discs came from or what they are.

In addition to being found in blackjack tables, J discs have also turned up in other types of casino machines, including slot machines and video poker machines. This has only added to the mystery surrounding them, as it’s not clear why someone would go to the trouble of placing them inside machines in various different casinos.

So far, no one has been able to determine what the J discs are or where they came from. While some people have suggested that they might be some sort of promotional item or a new type of currency, nothing has been confirmed yet. If you happen to find yourself at a casino in South Dakota and see a J disc, be sure to take a picture and share it with us!

#  What is a J in Blackjack? SD Casino Enthusiasts mystified!

In blackjack, the J is called a “point” card. Other point cards are the 10 and the Ace. When your point total reaches 21, you have a blackjack and automatically win the hand, unless the dealer has also drawn a blackjack.

When you are dealt two cards of the same rank, such as two 8s, that is also called a point total. The game of blackjack is all about making the best point total possible without going over 21.
