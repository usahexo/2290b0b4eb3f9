#  Study Shows Gambling Can Destroy Marriages 

When most people think about gambling, they think about winning big and exciting payouts. What few people think about is the potential for gambling to destroy marriages. A recent study has shown that gambling can have a dramatic impact on marriages, with a significant percentage of divorces being filed due to gambling addiction.

The study, which was conducted by the University of Calgary, looked at over 1,200 divorce cases in Alberta that involved gambling addiction. The results of the study showed that nearly one-third of all divorces in Alberta were related to gambling addiction. In addition, the study found that spouses of gamblers were three times more likely to file for divorce than those who were not married to a gambler.

What is even more concerning is that these numbers may be underestimating the true impact of gambling on marriages. The study only looked at divorces that were filed specifically because of a gambling addiction. There are likely many more marriages that are affected by gambling but do not result in a divorce.

Gambling can have a devastating impact on marriages for a number of reasons. First and foremost, gambling can be extremely addictive and can quickly become a compulsive behavior. When someone is addicted to gambling, they will do anything to get money to gamble with, including risking the stability of their marriage.

In addition, gambling can be incredibly stressful on a marriage. Couples who gamble together often find themselves arguing about money and bets. Gambling can also lead to mistrust and suspicion between partners as they wonder where the other person’s money is going.

Ultimately, gambling can destroy a marriage because it creates tension and conflict between partners and can lead to addiction and financial disaster. If you or your spouse has a problem with gambling, it is important to seek help before it destroys your marriage altogether

#  Gambling Can Ruin Your Relationship With Friends And Family 

It is no secret that gambling can have a negative impact on one's life. From ruining relationships with friends and family to causing financial problems, gambling can be a very harmful addiction.

#  Gambling: The Relationship Killer

Gambling can ruin relationships in a hurry. It can become an addiction that takes over a person’s life, affecting not only their personal relationships, but also their work and social life. Gambling often leads to financial instability and stress, which can put a lot of strain on any relationship.

When gambling becomes an addiction, it can be all-consuming. The person will start to gamble more and more frequently, and they will begin to neglect other areas of their life in order to gamble. This can include time with friends and family, work commitments, and even necessary errands. As the addiction grows worse, the person may start to steal or borrow money from loved ones in order to gamble.

Gambling addictions are also often linked with other addictions, such as drug or alcohol abuse. This can make the situation even more complicated and difficult to address. If one partner is struggling with an addiction, it is likely that the other partner is too. It is important for both partners to get help if this is the case.

Financial instability is another major issue that arises from gambling addictions. When a person is compulsively gambling, they are often spending more money than they have. This can lead to huge debts and financial problems. In some cases, the person may even have to file for bankruptcy because of their gambling debts. This can cause huge stress for both partners in a relationship.

If you or your partner has a gambling addiction, it is important to seek help immediately. There are many support groups available, as well as therapy sessions specifically tailored for gambling addictions. Address the problem as soon as possible before it destroys your relationship entirely.
