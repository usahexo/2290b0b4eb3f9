Tier 1: Heist Setup – A basic heist where players must set up vehicles, equipment and security for a larger heist. Tier 2: The Big Score – The final heist where players must steal money or valuables from a target location. Tier 3: McCready’s Jobs – These are specialty heists that often require unique skillsets or items to complete. Tier 4: Contract Missions – Hitman style missions that can be completed for big payouts.

Once a player has chosen a tier, they will need to complete three of that type of heist in order to unlock the next tier. Completing all four tiers will unlock access to the Casino’s vault, which contains even more lucrative jobs.

The rewards for successful completion of a Casino Heist vary depending on the tier, but can range from several hundred thousand dollars to over two million dollars.
