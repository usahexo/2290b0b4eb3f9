#  That Only Hurts When I Yowl: the Untold Story of Beach Blanket Bingo in Kenya

In 1966, a film crew from Paramount Pictures arrived in Mombasa, Kenya to shoot a movie. The film, Beach Blanket Bingo, would go on to become a cult classic, but the making of it was anything but easy.

The cast and crew faced numerous challenges while filming in Kenya. They had to contend with sandstorms, unpredictable weather, and difficult working conditions. But the biggest challenge of all was dealing with the exotic wildlife. Lions and elephants roamed free near the set, and monkeys invaded the wardrobe trailer, stealing clothes and creating chaos.

One of the most memorable scenes in the film was shot at a beach on Kenya's north coast. The cast and crew spent hours filming what would become known as "the surfing scene." But filming was not without its hazards. Actress Tina Louise almost drowned when a large wave knocked her off her board.

Despite the challenges, the cast and crew of Beach Blanket Bingo managed to create a classic film that has been enjoyed by audiences around the world for more than fifty years.

#  Kenya's Beach Blanket Bingo Craze: Fun and Games or a cover for Political Manipulation?

Kenya's Beach Blanket Bingo (BBI) initiative has been the talk of the town for months now. Proponents hail it as a much-needed development intervention that will create jobs, spur economic growth and develop the country's coastline. Critics see it as a thinly veiled attempt by the ruling party to buy votes ahead of the general election in 2022. So, what is really going on with BBI?

The Beach Blanket Bingo initiative was first announced by Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta in March 2019. The proposal entails the redevelopment of Kenya's coast from Lamu to Malindi into a tourism hotspot. The project will reportedly cost Kshs 700 billion (USD 7 billion) and will create over 1 million jobs.

However, many people remain skeptical about BBI'strue intentions. Some believe that the proposed infrastructure project is nothing more than a ploy by Uhuru Kenyatta's ruling party to buy votes in advance of the next general election in 2022. Others argue that the project is too costly and may not deliver on its promises.

Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga has been a vocal critic of BBI, calling it a "vote-buying scheme." He has also accused the ruling party of using state resources to fund its campaign for BBI. Raila Odinga and other opposition leaders have threatened to boycott the referendum on BBI if their concerns are not addressed.

So, what is really happening with Kenya's Beach Blanket Bingo initiative? Is it a development project or a vote-buying scheme? While there is no clear answer at this point, it is clear that there are many unanswered questions about BBI. It remains to be seen whether this controversial initiative will actually go ahead or be cancelled altogether.
