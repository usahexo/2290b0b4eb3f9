#  What is the Once Upon A Time craps online?

The Once Upon A Time craps online is a casino game that allows players to win money by predicting the outcome of a dice roll. The game can be played at home or in a casino, and is one of the most popular gambling games in the world.

To play the game, each player places a bet on either the Pass Line or Don't Pass Line. A shooter then rolls two dice and attempts to roll a 7 or 11, which results in a win for the Pass Line bettor, or a 2, 3, or 12, which results in a loss for the Pass Line bettor. If any other number is rolled, that becomes the point number. The shooter then continues rolling until either they roll the point number again (a win) or a 7 (a loss).

There are many different bets that can be made in addition to the Pass Line and Don't Pass Line bets, including Odds bets, Place bets, and Field bets. In order to win money on these bets, the player must correctly predict the outcome of the dice roll.

binary options 


The game of craps can seem intimidating to newcomers, but it's actually quite simple. In this article, we'll explain all of the basics of how to play craps so you can start enjoying this popular gambling game today.

To begin playing craps, each player first needs to make a bet on either the Pass Line or Don't Pass Line. These are simply betting options where you are predicting whether or not the next roll will result in a winner. If you choose to place your bet on the Pass Line, then you are betting that the next roll will be an 11 or 7; if you choose Don't Pass instead, then you are betting that 2, 3 or 12 will be rolled instead.

Once everyone has placed their initial bet, one player (the shooter) rolls two dice. If the total on these dice equals 7 or 11 (a "natural"), then whoever placed their bet on the Pass Line wins and everyone else loses; if 2, 3 or 12 are rolled (known as "craps"), then those who placed their bets on the Don't Pass line automatically win while everyone else loses. If any other number is rolled (the point), then that number becomes important for subsequent rolls. The shooter continues rolling until they either hit (roll again) their point number and thereby winnings Bettors who wagered on pass line  ,or they roll a 7 instead and thereby lose all wagers placed on pass line .
