#  Khimki is a NBA betting term

Khimki is a Russian city in the Moscow Oblast. The city is located on the Khimki Reservoir on the Moskva River, and is the northernmost city in Moscow Oblast. As of the 2010 Census, its population was 731,334.

The first mention of Khimki dates to 1393. However, the etymology of the name is not known. A popular hypothesis derives it from the name of the healing herb khimnik which was used by Russian tsars. Nikolay Yevlenko suggests that it might come from "the ancient Russian word for 'forest' (klimuk) or from the name of the Liman River which flowed into Khimki Reservoir".[1] Another theory suggests that it comes from Arabic words meaning "cold water" because of Khimki's location on a river.[2]

The territory of modern Khimki was part of Dmitrov and Serpukhov uezds of Moscow Governorate. It was granted town status in 1792.[3] In 1875, Khimki became a railway station on the Moscow-Ryazan railway. Although industrial enterprises were built in Khimki during the early Soviet period, its growth as a suburb of Moscow did not begin until late in the 1930s after construction of the Moscowâ€“Kiev highway (the Qualityatka). In 1938, Grigory Yeldachev founded an aviation factory Aerostroitel which produced Ilyushin Il-2 planes during World War II. 

After World War II, new housing development sprang up in the area. The town grew rapidly; by 1989 its population had reached 173,000. In 1991, Khimki became part of Moscow Oblast. Since then, its population has increased even further to 731,334 as of 2010 Census.[4][5]

In NFL betting, khimki refers to a bet placed on the favorite that pays less than the true odds, resulting in a profit for the bookmaker. For example, if a team is offered at -110 on the moneyline, a khimki would be a bet on that team at -105. In this instance, the bettor would risk $110 to win $100. 
The name of this type of wager comes from Russian, where it means "to chop".
