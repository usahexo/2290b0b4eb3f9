#  NBA superstar Charles Barkley lost a staggering $10 million in gambling over the years!

It's no secret that NBA superstar Charles Barkley is a big gambler. The 6'4" power forward has been open about his love of betting on sports, and over the years, it has cost him a lot of money.

Barkley has estimated that he's lost $10 million gambling over the years. That's a lot of cash, especially for someone who earns an estimated $40 million annually in salary and endorsements.

In a recent interview, Barkley said that he's cut back on his gambling in recent years. But he also acknowledged that he'll never stop betting altogether. "I'm not going to gamble anymore because I don't want to lose any more money," Barkley said. "But I'm not going to stop gambling altogether. I like to gamble."

Barkley is certainly not the only celebrity or athlete who enjoys gambling. Many famous people are hooked on the thrill of betting on sports or playing casino games. And while some wins can be sizable, losses can also be huge.

For example, tennis star Maria Sharapova admitted in 2016 that she had lost $1.5 million gambling in just one year! Soccer superstar Neymar is another high-profile player who has lost big money through gambling. In one notorious incident, Neymar reportedly lost $16 million in a single night at the casino!

It's easy to see why gambling can be so addictive for some people. The lure of potentially winning big money is strong, and it can be hard to resist the temptation to keep betting even when you are losing heavily.

Gambling can also be extremely harmful financially and emotionally. It can lead to large debts and ruined relationships. And for celebrities and athletes, it can tarnish their image and damage their reputation.

So if you're someone who enjoys gambling, be aware of the risks involved and try to keep your bets within reasonable limits. Otherwise, you could end up like Charles Barkley – losing tens of thousands of dollars over the years!

#  Charles Barkley blew through $10 million in just 7 years while gambling in Las Vegas!

It's no secret that Charles Barkley loves to gamble. In fact, the NBA Hall of Famer has blown through a whopping $10 million in just seven years while gambling in Las Vegas!

Most of that money was lost in just one year – 2012 – when Barkley is said to have lost around $4.6 million. Ouch!

Barkley has openly spoken about his gambling addiction, and even stated back in 2013 that he had "lost a lot of money gambling."

But despite his losses, Barkley shows no signs of quitting the casino life. In fact, he was recently seen arriving at the Cromwell Casino in Las Vegas for the Floyd Mayweather vs Conor McGregor fight.

While we can only hope that Barkley wins back some of his money with this latest trip to the casino, it's clear that he still has a long way to go if he wants to make up for all his previous losses.

#  Charles Barkley is known for his love of gambling, and it's cost him a fortune!

Charles Barkley has always had a love for gambling, and it's cost him a fortune! He estimated in 2013 that he had lost $10 million to gambling over the years. And that was before he lost an additional $1 million in just one night at the casino.

Barkley is obviously not the only celebrity to have lost money gambling, but he is one of the most high-profile cases. In fact, there are plenty of other celebrities who have lost millions to gambling, including Michael Jordan and Nicolas Cage.

But why do celebrities tend to lose so much money at casinos? There are a few possible explanations.

For one, celebrities often have a lot of money and they're used to getting what they want. This can lead to a sense of entitlement when they're playing casino games, where they feel like they can just keep betting until they eventually win.

Another possibility is that celebrities often have a lot of free time on their hands, which can lead to boredom and a desire to gamble in order to pass the time.

Finally, many celebrities are simply bad at gambling. They may make bad bets or chase their losses, which can quickly lead to them losing a lot of money.

No matter what the reason behind it is, it's clear that gambling can be very costly for celebrities. In addition to losing millions of dollars, they can also damage their reputation if it becomes public knowledge that they're addicted to gambling.

#  Charles Barkley lost millions of dollars from gambling, but says he has no regrets!

Charles Barkley, who is widely known as one of the best basketball players in history, has had a tumultuous off-the-court life. His gambling addiction has cost him millions of dollars over the years, but he says he has no regrets.

Barkley rose to fame in the 80s and 90s as a player for the Philadelphia 76ers and the Phoenix Suns. He was known for his dominant offensive skills, as well as his brash demeanor on and off the court. He was also known for his prowess as a gambler.

In fact, Barkley has admitted that he has lost millions of dollars from gambling over the years. In a 2013 interview, he said that he had lost "seven figures" at blackjack tables alone. That's not to mention all of the money he's lost on other forms of gambling, such as poker and sports betting.

Despite his huge losses, Barkley insists that he doesn't regret a thing. In fact, he says that gambling has actually made him a better person. "Gambling has been very good to me," Barkley said in 2013. "It's made me more humble. I've learned how to handle losing."

Barkley isn't the only high-profile individual with a gambling addiction. Celebrities such as Michael Jordan and Floyd Mayweather have also been known to lose millions of dollars from their wagers.

Interestingly, despite their huge losses, all three men have refused to give up gambling entirely. They continue to bet on sports and play casino games, even though it often results in them losing large sums of money.

Why do they continue to gamble even though they know they're likely to lose? Some experts say it's because these men are addicted to the thrill of winning (and losing). Others say it's because they're simply bad at math and can't seem to stop themselves from making stupid bets.



At any rate, Barkley's massive losses from gambling haven't stopped him from being one of the most successful basketball players in history. He was recently inducted into the Hall of Fame, and is currently an analyst for TNT's coverage of NBA games.
