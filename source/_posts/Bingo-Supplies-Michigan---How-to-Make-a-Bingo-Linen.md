#  Bingo Supplies Michigan - How to Make a Bingo Linen

Making a Bingo linen is an easy process that can be completed in about an hour. The supplies needed for this project include:
* Fabric - Cut a piece of fabric 24"x36". This will be the size of your Bingo linen. You can use any type of fabric you like, but I would recommend using a sturdy cotton or polyester blend.
* Markers or fabric paint - Choose your favorite colors and get creative with your design!
* Iron - This is optional, but I would recommend using an iron to help set the paint or markers.

To make your Bingo linen, start by folding the fabric in half lengthwise so that it is 12"x36". Then, fold the top edge down 1/4" and press to create a hem. Do this for all four sides of the fabric. Now it's time to add the design! You can use markers or fabric paint to create your design. If you're using markers, I would recommend using a permanent marker so that the design doesn't fade over time. If you're using fabric paint, make sure to follow the instructions on the bottle for drying time. Once your design is finished, press it with an iron if needed to help set the ink or paint. And that's it! Your Bingo linen is now ready to use!

2. In each square, write one letter of the alphabet.

3. Choose 25 words or phrases and write them down next to their corresponding letters.

4. To play, someone draws a random letter from a bag or hat, and everyone marks off any squares that have that letter in them. The first person to get 5 in a row (across, down, or diagonally) wins!

#  Making a Bingo Linen in Michigan

Making a Bingo Linen in Michigan is much like making a quilt, but with fabric pieces that are all the same size. The finished product can be used as a bedspread, a wall hanging, or even a table cloth. Best of all, it’s easy to make and doesn’t require any special skills or tools.

The first step is to choose the fabric for your Bingo Linen. You’llneed a piece of fabric that is at least 36 inches square. If you want to make a larger quilt, you can use multiple pieces of fabric, each measuring 36 inches square.

Next, cut the fabric into nine equal squares. You can use a ruler and a sharp pair of scissors to do this, or you can use a rotary cutter and mat to make the job easier.

Now it’s time to start sewing the squares together. Begin by folding one square in half diagonally, so that the two opposite corners meet. Sew these two corners together using a straight stitch.

Then fold the triangle in half again so that the right-angle corner now meets the middle of the triangle. Sew this corner in place using a straight stitch.

You should now have a small square that looks like an 8-pointed star. Repeat these steps with the remaining eight squares, until you have created a large star block measuring 36 inches across.

If you don’t want to sew by hand, you can use your sewing machine to stitch the squares together instead. Just be sure to set the machine to a short stitch length (1 or 2) and use a small zigzag stitch pattern. This will help prevent the fabric from puckering as you sew it together.

Once your star block is complete, it’s time to add some borders. Cut two strips of fabric that are each 36 inches long and 5 inches wide. Sew these strips to the left and right edges of your star block, using a straight stitch and leaving about ½ inch of space between the strip and the edge of the block.

Finally, cut another strip of fabric that is 36 inches long but only 2½ inches wide. Sew this strip along the top and bottom edges of your star block, again leaving about ½ inch of space between the strip and the edge of block.

Your Bingo Linen is now finished! Feel free to add some quilting stitches if you like, or just leave it as is. Enjoy using your new handmade quilt!
